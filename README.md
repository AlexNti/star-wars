Thisngs to improve

- add pagination (some of the work has already been done components,functions,etc)
- Expand the creation of wiki pages of startships and planets (some of the work has already been done)
- Try to see if we abstract the useWikiPeople,useWikiPlanets and useWikiStarships in a single function.
- Improve resposiveness of the app UI
- Better naming for WIKI and WikiPage the naming might lead to confusion
- Build a mechanism for the profile to first check the QUERIES get all result
- We can try to generalize the errors and loading states.
- keep the state of accordion when navigating fron and back in the page.
- Use context at favourites can lead to perfomance issue when app is scaling, for now it just fine but we have to consider optimazing or changing the way we manage the local state.
